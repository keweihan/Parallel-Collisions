# Parallelization Schemes for Collision Detection
**URL**: https://keweihan.github.io/keweihan-15618-parallel-final-collision/
# Summary
We are going to explore parallelizing spatial grid structures such as a fixed spatial grid and quadtree to optimize collision detection using CUDA.

# Background
[TODO]

# Challenge
[TODO]
1. Challenge in distributing workload evenlyt

# Resources
GHC Machines and personal windows machines with GPU

# Goals and Deliverables
## Plan to Achieve
[TODO: Elaborate]
Spatial grid construction parallelization
Quadtree construction parallelization for uneven work distribution

## Hope to Achieve
[TODO: Elaborate]
Parallelization of collision resolution step too

# Platform Choice
GHC

# Schedule
[TODO: At least one item per week]
| Week         | Task       |
|--------------|-----------:|
| Nov 17 - 23  | [TODO: Desc] |
